        <h1>Leonhard Euler (1707-1783)</h1>
        <p>
            The greatest mathematician of the eighteenth century, <b>Leonhard Euler</b> was born in Basel, Switzerland. There, he studied under another giant<br/>
            of mathematics, <b>Jean Bernoulli</b>. In 1731 Euler became a professor of physics and mathematics at St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences. Euler <br/>
            was the most prolific mathematician of all time, publishing over 800 different books and papers. His influence was felt in physics and<br/>
            astronomy as well. Euler's work on mathematical analysis, <i>Introductio in analysin infinitorum</i> (1748) remained a standard textbook for well <br/>
            over a century. For the princess of Anhalt-Dessau he wrote <i>Lettres a une princesse d'Allemagne</i> (1768‚Äì1772), giving a clear non-technical <br/>
            outline of the main physical theories of the time.

            One can hardly do math without copying Euler. Notations still in use today, such as e and pi, were introduced in Euler's writings. He is perhaps <br/>
            best known for his research into mathematical analysis. Euler's formula:
            <p>cos(x)+isin(x)=e<sup>ix</sup></p>
            <p>demonstrates the relationship between algebra, complex analysis, and trigonometry. From this equation, it's easy to derive the equation:</p>
            <p>e<sup>iœÄ</sup> + 1=0</p>
            <p>which relates the fundamental constants: 0, 1,  &#8508;, e, and ùëñ in a single beautiful and elegant statement.</p>
            <p>Leonhard Euler died in 1783, leaving behind a legacy perhaps unmatched, and certainly unsurpassed, in the annals of mathematics.</p>
